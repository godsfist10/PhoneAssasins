	///
	/// Amazon DynamoDB <b>Overview</b> 
	/// <para>
	/// This is the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference. This guide provides descriptions and samples
	/// of the low-level DynamoDB API. For information about DynamoDB application development,
	/// go to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/">Amazon
	/// DynamoDB Developer Guide</a>.
	/// </para>
	///  
	/// <para>
	/// Instead of making the requests to the low-level DynamoDB API directly from your application,
	/// we recommend that you use the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs). The easy-to-use
	/// libraries in the AWS SDKs make it unnecessary to call the low-level DynamoDB API directly
	/// from your application. The libraries take care of request authentication, serialization,
	/// and connection management. For more information, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/UsingAWSSDK.html">Using
	/// the AWS SDKs with DynamoDB</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.
	/// </para>
	///  
	/// <para>
	/// If you decide to code against the low-level DynamoDB API directly, you will need to
	/// write the necessary code to authenticate your requests. For more information on signing
	/// your requests, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/API.html">Using
	/// the DynamoDB API</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.

	///  <b>Managing Tables</b> 
	/// </para>
	///  
	/// <para>
	///  <ul> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>CreateTable</i> - Creates a table with user-specified provisioned throughput settings.
	/// You must designate one attribute as the hash primary key for the table; you can optionally
	/// designate a second attribute as the range primary key. DynamoDB creates indexes on
	/// these key attributes for fast data access. Optionally, you can create one or more
	/// secondary indexes, which provide fast data access using non-key attributes.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>DescribeTable</i> - Returns metadata for a table, such as table size, status, and
	/// index information.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>UpdateTable</i> - Modifies the provisioned throughput settings for a table. Optionally,
	/// you can modify the provisioned throughput settings for global secondary indexes on
	/// the table.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>ListTables</i> - Returns a list of all tables associated with the current AWS account
	/// and endpoint.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>DeleteTable</i> - Deletes a table and all of its indexes.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> </ul> 
	/// </para>

	/// <para>
	/// For conceptual information about managing tables, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html">Working
	/// with Tables</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.

	/// <para>
	///  <b>Reading Data</b> 
	/// </para>
	///  
	/// <para>
	///  <ul> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>GetItem</i> - Returns a set of attributes for the item that has a given primary
	/// key. By default, <i>GetItem</i> performs an eventually consistent read; however, applications
	/// can specify a strongly consistent read instead.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>BatchGetItem</i> - Performs multiple <i>GetItem</i> requests for data items using
	/// their primary keys, from one table or multiple tables. The response from <i>BatchGetItem</i>
	/// has a size limit of 16 MB and returns a maximum of 100 items. Both eventually consistent
	/// and strongly consistent reads can be used.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>Query</i> - Returns one or more items from a table or a secondary index. You must
	/// provide a specific hash key value. You can narrow the scope of the query using comparison
	/// operators against a range key value, or on the index key. <i>Query</i> supports either
	/// eventual or strong consistency. A single response has a size limit of 1 MB.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>Scan</i> - Reads every item in a table; the result set is eventually consistent.
	/// You can limit the number of items returned by filtering the data attributes, using
	/// conditional expressions. <i>Scan</i> can be used to enable ad-hoc querying of a table
	/// against non-key attributes; however, since this is a full table scan without using
	/// an index, <i>Scan</i> should not be used for any application query use case that requires
	/// predictable performance.
	/// </para>

	/// </para>
	///  
	/// <para>
	///  <ul> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>PutItem</i> - Creates a new item, or replaces an existing item with a new item
	/// (including all the attributes). By default, if an item in the table already exists
	/// with the same primary key, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You
	/// can use conditional operators to replace an item only if its attribute values match
	/// certain conditions, or to insert a new item only if that item doesn't already exist.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>UpdateItem</i> - Modifies the attributes of an existing item. You can also use
	/// conditional operators to perform an update only if the item's attribute values match
	/// certain conditions.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>DeleteItem</i> - Deletes an item in a table by primary key. You can use conditional
	/// operators to perform a delete an item only if the item's attribute values match certain
	/// conditions.
	/// </para>
	///  </li> <li> 
	/// <para>
	/// <i>BatchWriteItem</i> - Performs multiple <i>PutItem</i> and <i>DeleteItem</i> requests
	/// across multiple tables in a single request. A failure of any request(s) in the batch
	/// will not cause the entire <i>BatchWriteItem</i> operation to fail. Supports batches
	/// of up to 25 items to put or delete, with a maximum total request size of 16 MB.

If you are updating an attribute that is an index key attribute for any indexes on that table, the attribute type must match the index key type defined in the <i>AttributesDefinition</i> of the table description. You can use <i>UpdateItem</i> to update any nonkey attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. String and Binary type attributes must have lengths greater than zero. Set type attributes must not be empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a <i>ValidationException</i> exception. Each <i>AttributeUpdates</i> element consists of an attribute name to modify, along with the following: <ul> <li> <i>Value</i> - The new value, if applicable, for this attribute. </li> <li> <i>Action</i> - A value that specifies how to perform the update.

If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value.  </li> <li> <code>DELETE</code> - Removes the attribute and its value, if no value is specified for <code>DELETE</code>. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specifies <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error. </li> <li> <code>ADD</code> - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute: <ul> <li> If the existing attribute is a number, and if <i>Value</i> is also a number, then <i>Value</i> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <i>Value</i> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. </li> <li> If the existing data type is a set, and if <i>Value</i> is also a set, then <i>Value</i> is appended to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an <code>ADD</code> action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type.  Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, <i>Value</i> must also be a set of strings. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> If no item with the specified key is found in the table, the following values perform the following actions:  <ul> <li> <code>PUT</code> - Causes DynamoDB to create a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute.  </li> <li> <code>DELETE</code> - Causes nothing to happen; there is no attribute to delete. </li> <li> <code>ADD</code> - Causes DynamoDB to creat an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value.

		/// <param name="tableName">The name of the table containing the item to update. </param>
		/// <param name="key">The primary key of the item to be updated. Each element consists of an attribute name and a value for that attribute. For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For example, with a hash type primary key, you only need to specify the hash attribute. For a hash-and-range type primary key, you must specify both the hash attribute and the range attribute.</param>
		/// <param name="attributeUpdates"><important> There is a newer parameter available. Use <i>UpdateExpression</i> instead. Note that if you use <i>AttributeUpdates</i> and <i>UpdateExpression</i> at the same time, DynamoDB will return a <i>ValidationException</i> exception. This parameter can be used for modifying top-level attributes; however, it does not support individual list or map elements. </important> The names of attributes to be modified, the action to perform on each, and the new value for each. If you are updating an attribute that is an index key attribute for any indexes on that table, the attribute type must match the index key type defined in the <i>AttributesDefinition</i> of the table description. You can use <i>UpdateItem</i> to update any nonkey attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. String and Binary type attributes must have lengths greater than zero. Set type attributes must not be empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a <i>ValidationException</i> exception. Each <i>AttributeUpdates</i> element consists of an attribute name to modify, along with the following: <ul> <li> <i>Value</i> - The new value, if applicable, for this attribute. </li> <li> <i>Action</i> - A value that specifies how to perform the update. This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is Number or is a set; do not use <code>ADD</code> for other data types.  If an item with the specified primary key is found in the table, the following values perform the following actions: <ul> <li> <code>PUT</code> - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value.  </li> <li> <code>DELETE</code> - Removes the attribute and its value, if no value is specified for <code>DELETE</code>. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specifies <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error. </li> <li> <code>ADD</code> - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute: <ul> <li> If the existing attribute is a number, and if <i>Value</i> is also a number, then <i>Value</i> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <i>Value</i> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. </li> <li> If the existing data type is a set, and if <i>Value</i> is also a set, then <i>Value</i> is appended to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an <code>ADD</code> action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type.  Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, <i>Value</i> must also be a set of strings. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> If no item with the specified key is found in the table, the following values perform the following actions:  <ul> <li> <code>PUT</code> - Causes DynamoDB to create a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute.  </li> <li> <code>DELETE</code> - Causes nothing to happen; there is no attribute to delete. </li> <li> <code>ADD</code> - Causes DynamoDB to creat an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are Number and Number Set. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition.</param>
		/// <param name="returnValues">Use <i>ReturnValues</i> if you want to get the item attributes as they appeared either before or after they were updated. For <i>UpdateItem</i>, the valid values are: <ul> <li> <code>NONE</code> - If <i>ReturnValues</i> is not specified, or if its value is <code>NONE</code>, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for <i>ReturnValues</i>.) </li> <li> <code>ALL_OLD</code> - If <i>UpdateItem</i> overwrote an attribute name-value pair, then the content of the old item is returned. </li> <li> <code>UPDATED_OLD</code> - The old versions of only the updated attributes are returned. </li> <li> <code>ALL_NEW</code> - All of the attributes of the new version of the item are returned. </li> <li> <code>UPDATED_NEW</code> - The new versions of only the updated attributes are returned. </li> </ul></param>
